## Introduction ##

This National Population Failsafe Management (NPFM) Specification details the FHIR components required to fulfill the data item requirements of the following communications:

- **National Failsafe Alert** - a notification of action to be taken by the receiving service to fulfill a national failsafe requirement 
- **National Failsafe Alert Nullify Request** - a request from services to nullify failsafe alerts where appropriate.

These communications will be published or received by the [Events Management Service](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/interoperability/events-management-service) (EMS).

{% include important.html content="This site is under active development by NHS Digital and is intended to provide the FHIR messaging components for National Population Failsafe Management, and remains subject to review.
