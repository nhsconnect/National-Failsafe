## Background ##
FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and where applicable, use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the [INTEROPen](http://interopen.org) community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

## Application of CareConnect STU3 FHIR profiles for Events Management Service ##

This Beta specification release includes FHIR profiles derived from the following CareConnect STU3 FHIR profiles and their supporting artefacts, which have been published following INTEROPen curation on the [HL7-UK github repository](https://github.com/HL7-UK/CareConnect-profiles-STU3/):

- [CareConnect-Location-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Location-1)
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Practitioner-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Practitioner-1)
- [CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-PractitionerRole-1)

Derived FHIR profiles have been developed with reference to the INTEROPen document ['Deriving-CareConnect-Profiles'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fe6_w78BiNKwAnmsJi0-oQe7TRc2VpFqUQGpdpbkn7s/edit#heading=h.v4n7w91x36ud).
