## FHIR ##
The FHIR profiles for this specification have been developed using the [FHIR Release STU3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/index.html) specification, and the [Digital Child Health Events Alpha Specification](https://data.developer.nhs.uk/specifications/dch-alpha/Chapter.1.About/index.html) as a use case.

## [INTEROPen](http://www.interopen.org)

FHIR components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

See [CareConnect FHIR Profiles](support_careconnect.html) for further clarification on the use of CareConnect FHIR profiles within this specification.
