## The EMS Event Message Bundle Structure ##

To enable a standardised structure to carry information within the scope of the [Events Management Service](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/interoperability/events-management-service), the EMS Message Bundle and the EMS Message Header combine to make up the initial event message bundle structure:

This is consistent with the [FHIR specification for the Bundle resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html#message), which states that 'A message bundle (type = "message") consists of a series of entries, the first of which is a MessageHeader.'  

**MessageHeader focus**

The root class of the MessageHeader is fulfilled using the 'focus' element in the resource. This will reference the appropriate resource depending on the following conditions:

- for clinical events, the 'focus' will reference an [Encounter](http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html) resource
- for information alerts or updates, the 'focus' will reference a [Communication](http://hl7.org/fhir/communication.html) resource
- for any other events yet to be scoped, it is expected that the 'focus' may be any FHIR resource where the 'subject' element is fulfilled by a reference to a [Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) resource.

## The EMS Event Message Bundle Structure with Event Header Items ##

The following components are then added to the initial EMS Event Message Bundle structure in order to fulfill the [event header requirement](explore_event_header_design.html).

**Organisation resources in EMS Event Message Bundle Structure**

Where possible, the EMS bundle will contain an absolute URL reference to an Organization resource, which can be retrieved as described in the [FHIR ODS Lookup API Implementation guide](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/restfulapis_identification_organization.html).

## The EMS Event Message Bundle Structure with EMS Data Items ##

Finally, using the [National Failsafe Alert](explore_national_failsafe_alert.html) as an example, the following components are added to the EMS Event Message Bundle structure in order to fulfill the data item requirements specific to the event.
